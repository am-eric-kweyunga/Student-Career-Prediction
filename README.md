# Student-Career-Prediction
A Python and ML program to predict the best career for students on the basis of their interests. I have used DecisionTree, NaiveByes and Random Forest Tree to predict the career/course.
# How to use
Create a python virtual environment.
Download all necessary dependencies.
Open the student prediction file and run the file. Student test and Student train files are used to test and train the model and predict the career.
When program opens type the name of student and select five interests from the dropdown.
Click on the buttons provided to predict the course for student.
